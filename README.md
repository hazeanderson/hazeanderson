👋 Welcome to my Github profile! 🎛️🔊💻

I'm passionate about all things audio circuits and software development. Here, you'll find my projects and contributions in designing and building both digital and analog audio circuits 🎛️🎚️. I love exploring the fascinating world of sound and tinkering with different components to create unique experiences!

Alongside audio circuitry, I also dive into the world of programming. I enjoy working with Scheme 📝 and honing my skills in functional programming. 🧠🖥️ Additionally, I like to implement Object Oriented Design Patterns authored by the Gang of Four in Python 🐍✨. It's amazing how patterns enhance software structure and reusability!

Feel free to explore my repositories and dive into the colorful world of audio circuits and software development. 🎉

✉️ Let's connect! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about these exciting topics. Happy exploring! 🌟
