## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find a collection of my works and explorations in the fascinating domains of audio circuit design, analog and digital audio systems, functional programming with Scheme, and implementing object-oriented design patterns with Python.

Feel free to explore the repositories to learn more about my passions and projects.

## Electronic Circuits

Within my repositories, you may find various projects related to the design and construction of digital and analog electronic circuits. If you share the same affinity for audio circuits or want to learn more about this field, please feel free to dive into the relevant repositories.

## Functional Programming with Scheme

Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, is a versatile and elegant functional programming language. I enjoy exploring different problem-solving approaches using functional programming paradigms. If you are interested in functional programming or curious about Scheme, you might find some interesting pieces of code and projects among my repositories.

## Object-Oriented Design Patterns with Python

You may stumble upon repositories where I have applied the Gang of Four authored Object-Oriented Design Patterns to Python projects. If you are keen to learn about different design patterns or wish to see their implementation in Python, you may find my repositories helpful.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding my projects or areas of interest, please feel free to reach out. I would be more than happy to engage in discussions related to audio circuits, functional programming, or object-oriented design patterns.

Happy coding!
